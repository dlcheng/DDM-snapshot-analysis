1. for small halos, the cNFW given by AHF let some of the r_s too small to have any particles inside it, now these halos are marked as not trustworthy for mass bin analysis.
2. plot the log(dN / dlogM) mass function and the normalized decay fraction.   
3. add the vel bin based analysis

8-12-2012
1. add the analysis of the distribution of subhalos particle numbers

9-3-2012
1. add the mode of fixing mass bin, seee define.h

10-4-2012
1. calculate cNFW from Vmax and Rmax with defined radius bin numbers

10-24-2012
1. Output detailed halo profile (dark matter only)

11-22-2012
1. Add the analysis of decayed particle produced time.

2-20-2013
1. Redesign the analysis of sub-structures.

2-23-2013
1. Need to tread with get_mean_values() to include new parameters

2-26-2013
1. The mean value of halo properties except those related to the NFW parameter, are now calculated from 
   soft_trust_flag.

3-04-2013 
1. Load the no-decay comparision simulation, the no-decay simulation determines the sub mass bin

11-22-2013
1. Add the mode to output halo density profile (both CDM and DDM), mass range controled in write_file.c.

V-0.3
1. remove the comparison with CDM
2. subhaloes are binned directly to their mass
3. Catalogue is made for Milky Way like structures (for post-process of python)
